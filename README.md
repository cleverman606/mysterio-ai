# Info
Where I am going to make my own custom **dumb** open source AI. Watch me create my own AI. Download using Ollama. (`ollama.com/models`). I want this AI to be somewhat good at simple coding in Python, CSS, and HTML. Download it when it comes out! Called `MystAI`. (not to be confused with mystral or mixtral). Should be able to write at least some Python. If this project is sucsessful, I will make it smarter.

# Stuff for nerds
Will be trained on `100k context tokens`. Tempurature of `0.85` for some randomness but not too much. I will add more info as I start the project here.
